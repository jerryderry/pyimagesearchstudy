This repository contains my scripts and notes while I'm learning computer vision on PyImageSearch. The course was designed by Adrian Rosebrock.

The scripts are not exact copies from those provided by Adrian. I manually typed them and make adjustments while studying the contents.

I used OpenCV 3 and Python 3.6.
